The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive knowledge management system, Wellness Archive, for an orthomolecular practice, addressing various complex requirements incrementally. The initial phase focused on setting up the React frontend with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB, integrating Claude Sonnet 4 via . Key features implemented include document import (copy-paste, file upload), automatic AI-driven tag generation, document detail views, editing capabilities, custom categories, and navigation by categories and tags. A significant challenge was ensuring robust file storage with GridFS and handling MongoDB  serialization errors, which required several iterations and fixes in the backend. The AI also implemented automatic English-to-Dutch translation for document content and an initial backend for speech-to-text, although the frontend for this remains pending. The AI demonstrated resilience in debugging syntax errors, API failures, and logic flaws, systematically testing after each major change.

<product_requirements>
The user, an orthomolecular naturopathic therapist, requested a web application to bundle, store, and utilize extensive knowledge (articles, research, books, notes) for consultations, diagnostics, treatment plans, and advice (supplements, herbs, gemmo). The application, named Wellness Archive, has evolved through several feature additions:

1.  **Initial MVP (Implicit):** A dashboard for an overview and an AI assistant for consultations and generating treatment plans.
2.  **Content Import & Tagging:**
    *   Ability to copy-paste text and upload various document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, images).
    *   Automatic AI-driven tag generation from imported content.
    *   Storage of all knowledge in a central knowledge base.
3.  **Document Management:**
    *   Document detail view to see full content.
    *   Edit functionality for title, tags, and category.
    *   User-defined custom categories.
    *   A field for references/sources, with potential for AI detection.
4.  **Content Viewing:**
    *   Display original uploaded PDFs in a viewer within the document details.
    *   Display original uploaded images directly in the document details.
    *   For copy-pasted text, only display the text content.
5.  **Navigation & Organization:**
    *   Dashboard overview of categories with document counts.
    *   Clickable categories to view all documents within that category.
    *   Clickable tags to view all documents associated with that tag.
    *   Navigation from category/tag view to document details.
6.  **Automatic Translation:** Automatically translate English documents to Dutch upon upload.
7.  **Speech-to-Text Input (Partial):** Ability to record spoken text and process it like other uploads (backend implemented, frontend pending).

-   **React Router DOM:** For client-side routing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** This is the core of the backend, defining all API endpoints, database interactions, and AI logic.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Initial setup for document CRUD, AI chat, treatment plans, and basic stats.
        -   Integrated  for Claude Sonnet 4.
        -   Added document upload (text, PDF, image) endpoints using GridFS for file storage.
        -   Implemented AI tag generation, language detection, and English-to-Dutch translation.
        -   Introduced endpoints for category and tag filtering.
        -   Implemented robust  serialization handling for MongoDB responses.
        -   Added an endpoint for speech-to-text conversion (using ).
        -   Modified to correctly store  and .
        -   Refactored GridFS handling to work with  for synchronous operations in the context of asynchronous FastAPI endpoints.
        -   Enhanced error handling for AI calls.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Stores environment variables, specifically  and .
    -   **Changes Made:**  was added for configurable database naming.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** The main React component, handling application routing, state management, and rendering of different views.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Implemented React Router for navigation (Dashboard, KnowledgeBase, DocumentDetail, ConsultAssistant).
        -   Created UI for document import (copy-paste, file upload) with category selection and AI tagging.
        -   Developed Dashboard view with category statistics and clickable categories.
        -   Implemented KnowledgeBase view with a list of documents, category/tag filtering, and a side-panel for document details.
        -   Introduced DocumentDetail view (both standalone page and inline panel) to display content, original files (PDF viewer, image display), edit/delete buttons, and translation indicators.
        -   Integrated API calls to the backend for all document operations.
        -   Added logic for rendering different content types (text, PDF, image).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a critical review of the entire system. All previously requested features are confirmed to be fully functional and robust.

Specifically, the current state includes:
*   **Knowledge Dashboard:** Displays an overview of documents grouped by categories, showing document counts per category. Categories are clickable, leading to a filtered view of documents.
*   **Document List/Knowledge Base:** Presents all documents. Tags within documents are clickable, allowing users to filter documents by specific tags.
*   **Document Detail View:** Accessible from both category/tag filtered lists and the main knowledge base. It displays the document's full content, title, AI-generated tags, and user-defined categories.
*   **Edit/Delete Functionality:** Buttons for editing and deleting documents are available and functional within the document detail view, both on the dedicated  page and within the side panel on the  page.
*   **Content Import:** Supports copy-pasting text, uploading PDF files, and uploading image files.
*   **AI Tag Generation:** Automatically generates relevant tags for all imported content using Claude Sonnet 4.
*   **Automatic Translation:** Detects English documents upon upload and automatically translates their content and generated tags into Dutch.
*   **Original File View:** For uploaded PDFs, a viewer displays the original document directly in the detail view. For uploaded images, the image is displayed. For copy-pasted text, only the text is shown.
*   **Backend for Speech-to-Text:** The  endpoint is implemented using  and Whisper for converting audio to text. However, the corresponding frontend UI for recording and uploading audio is still pending.

The last interaction involved a comprehensive system health check and flow testing, confirming the stability and functionality of all implemented features.
